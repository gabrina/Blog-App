Episode 297:
-working with grid to set up the main page:
note: the griding method mentioned in the videos doesn't working:
->a Grid with property "container" that wraps all items.
->every child is a Grid component ith the property "item".
->define the width on different sizes by passing an object to the property "size":
size={{ xs: 12, md: 9 }}
note:every unit of Material UI is 8px;
for example: padding:{3} equals to 24 px

Episode298:
-defining layout:
->defining Footer.js
->we already defined Header.js
->defining Layout.js to have a single component that wraps the whole thing

small irrelevant note: when we define multiple index.js in every folder, when we want to import that file, we cam omit the file name.

rendering blogs and order them:
note: there are several ways to pass post info to it's card:
1- to pass the post as post={post}
2- to pass each data individually like title={title} author={author} etc.
3- to spread it before passing, and receive each data individually:
in parent: <CardEL {...post} />
in child: function CardEL(props)
